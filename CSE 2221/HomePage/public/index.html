	<h2>About Me:</h2>
	<p>My name is Arun Ghimire. I am a junior here at Ohio State
		University. I am majoring in computer science and engineering. I love
		working with computers, whether it's programming them or building
		them. My first somewhat in-depth exposure to computers goes all the
		way back to when I was in middle school. I wanted to play this game,
		but for some reason, my computer just couldn't handle running it. I
		tried and tried, but nothing worked, so I started doing research and
		Eventually, I learned about CPUs, GPUs, and everything else in
		between. In the end, I decided to become a computer engineer, the very
		decision that led me to this class.</p>
